                    swift pace using one's legs to propel the body forward. Running is an effective way to improve cardiovascular health, 
                    increase endurance, and burn calories. Running can be done on a treadmill or outside on various terrains such as roads, 
                    trails, or tracks. Running workouts can range in intensity from steady-state runs to interval training or high-intensity sprints.  
                    Running is a popular and convenient form of exercise that can be done alone or with a group, and can be enjoyed by individuals of all fitness levels.</p>
