                    psychological, and social well-being, in which an individual is able to cope with the stresses of daily life, 
                    work productively, and contribute to their community. Mental wellbeing encompasses a range of factors such as 
                    self-esteem, resilience, positive relationships, and a sense of purpose and meaning in life. 
                    Good mental wellbeing can be promoted through various strategies such as practicing mindfulness, 
                    engaging in physical activity, seeking support from friends and family, and seeking professional help when needed.</p>
